# React Guest List

Create a guest list app using React.

TODOs:

- [x] First name input field with a related "First name" label
- [x] Last name input field with a related "Last name" label
- [x] Create a new guest upon pressing "Return" in the last name input
- [x] Input fields should be empty after adding a new guest
- [x] Each guest (all content and HTML elements related to a guest) should be contained inside a div element with the attribute data-test-id="guest"

- [x] Deleting a guest by pressing a "Remove" button

- [x] Each guest has a checkbox (empty by default, aria-label which contains the text attending)
- [ ] Checked box = attending, unchecked = not attending

- [ ] API checkbox (later)
